# Verado Front End Test

## Task

If you are a new candidate please create a new branch and create a pull request. Please make sure you are using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to structure your project.

The aim of this test is to build a chat interface for [staging.verado.com](https://staging.verado.com) that matches the sites 'theme' as well as using your own initiative to add animations, style and UX you feel would work well for our particular use case.

Things you must include are:

* Chat threads
* A main chat section
* Input for a message
* A special message that can be sent which includes an offer to the buyer

Please make sure your code is commented but not over commented, clean reusable code. Absolutely **no JQuery**.

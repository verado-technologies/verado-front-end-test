# Verado Front End Test

## Task

Dear Candidate, 

thanks for applying to the Frond End Developer position @ Verado.com - we are excited to progress your application. 

Please create a new branch and create a pull request. Please make sure you are using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to structure your project.

The aim of this test is to build a chat interface for [staging.verado.com](https://staging.verado.com) that matches the sites 'theme' as well as using your own initiative to add animations, style and UX you feel would work well for our particular use case. Please include some animations.

As you know Verado.com is a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of pre-owned valuable goods. The chat system will be the way for sellers and buyers to communicate directly. Sellers should be able to send a special offer to the buyers and buyers should be able to accept or reject it. 

Things you must include are:

* Chat threads
* A main chat section
* Input for a message
* A special message that can be sent which includes an offer to the buyer
* Pop up / modal window for the buyer to accept or reject the offer
* Option for the seller to send a special offer and define the amount
* Please include at least 3 transitions and 2 animations

Please make sure your code is commented but not over commented, clean reusable code. Absolutely **no JQuery**.

NB: the test MUST be completed within 12 hours. 

Thanks, 
Verado.com Team
